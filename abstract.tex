The explosion of social media allowed individuals to spread information without cost, with little investigation and fewer ﬁlters than before. This ampliﬁed the problem of fake news, which became a major concern nowadays due to the negative impact it brings to the communities. In order to tackle the rise and spread of fake news, automatic detection techniques have been researched building on artiﬁcial intelligence and machine learning. The recent achievements of deep learning techniques in complex natural language processing tasks, make them a promising solution for fake news detection too. This work researches a hybrid deep learning model that combines convolutional and recurrent neural networks and attention weights for fake news classiﬁcation. The baseline CNN model and CNN-LSTM showed similar precision, recall, F1-score metrics with 96\% on all metrics, while CNN-Attention has slight increase in precision, recall and F1-score with 97\% on all metrics. CNN model and CNN-LSTM showed accuracy of about 96\% and CNN-Attention showed the accuracy of 97.14\%. The confusion matrix showed CNN-Attention has highest true positives  while baseline CNN has highest true negative predictions. \\
